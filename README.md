# four-function-calculator
I designed a four function calculator for my Programming II course. The calculator is designed to function exactly like a typical four function calculator. The GUI components were given by my professor as part of this project; the rest of the code is mine.

# Usage
Run the file `SetUp.java` to use the calculator.
